# Lane Detection Segmentation using YOLOv11

This repository provides a deep learning solution for **lane detection segmentation** using the **YOLOv11 segmentation model**. The project is implemented in Python using the **Ultralytics YOLO** framework and is optimized for training on custom lane datasets.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

Lane detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). This project uses **YOLOv11-seg** to accurately segment lane markings, including **solid and dashed lines** on both left and right boundaries.

**Key Features:**

* Segment lanes in real-time
* Handles multiple lane types (solid/dashed)
* High precision and recall for both bounding boxes and masks
* Early stopping to prevent overfitting

## ðŸ”¹ Model Training

The model is trained using **YOLOv11-seg** with the following configuration:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO('yolo11n-seg.pt')
!yolo segment train \
  data="data.yaml" \
  model=yolo11n-seg.pt \
  epochs=200 \
  patience=30 \
  imgsz=640 \
  name="lane-seg"
```

**Training Details:**

* **Epochs:** 200 (training stopped early at 144 due to EarlyStopping)
* **Image size:** 640
* **Patience:** 30 epochs
* **Best Model:** `best.pt`
* **Hardware:** Tesla T4 GPU, CUDA acceleration

## ðŸ”¹ Validation and Inference

After training, the best model `best.pt` was validated on a test set, showing **high accuracy and mask quality**.

**Inference Speed:**

* Preprocess: 0.1 ms per image
* Inference: 2.7 ms per image
* Postprocess: 4.3 ms per image

The trained model can be used to **segment lane markings on new images** with high reliability.

```python
results = model("/path/to/test/images", conf=0.6)
results.show()
```
